# Micro-seusmic-monitoring-of-a-floating-ice-plate
The companion files are the catalog related to the processing of micro-seismic data and torque measurements presented in the manuscript 'Micro-seismic monitoring of a floating ice plate to monitor its deformation' done by C. Lachaud, D. Marsan, M. Montagnat, J. Weiss, L. Moreau and F. Gimbert

Sampling frequency of the torque measurement is 10 Hz and the accuracy is 0.25Nm. It corresponds to the torque evolution of the fault after the initial rupture. 

The seismic catalog has been constructed from the detected fractures. Details about the detection and processing are in the paper. 

There is 19 columns and 24938 lignes. The columns are the; fracture number, time, angular position (in rad), final location step (1 for the triangulation, and 3 for the double difference), clip (0 is not, 1 either), acceleration maximum of QS0 mode, acceleration maximum, velocity maximum of QS0 mode, velocity maximum, displacement maximum of QS0 mode, displacement maximum, signal energy (square of the velocity), QSO half period (s), fracture length (m, assuming v_r=1675m/s), horizontal displacement of the fracture (m), seismic moment (Nm) assuming linearly thickening of the fault width (1mm/h), seismic moment assuming constant ice thickness (W=6mm), moment magnitude assuming linearly thickening of the fault width, moment magnitude assuming constant ice thickness

The ice shear stifness is taken equal to 3.52GPa.
